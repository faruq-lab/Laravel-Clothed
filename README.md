# CLOTHED (Used Items Advertising Website) - Laravel Project

This project is a web application developed using the Laravel framework, inspired by the **Traversy Media** YouTube channel tutorial. You can find the original tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYyJ4PuL4pY). While the core foundation of this project is based on the tutorial, I have made several modifications and improvements to better suit the requirements and to enhance my understanding of Laravel.

## Project Overview

This website allows users to post advertisements for their used clothes and items. It features two types of users:

1. **Common User**: Users who can register, log in, and create listings for their items.
2. **Admin**: Users who have administrative privileges. Note that admin users do not have a registration process and must be added manually to the database, either through direct database manipulation or using a database migration.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Common users can register and log in to manage their advertisements.
- **Admin Management**: Admins have the ability to manage all listings on the platform. Admin accounts are created manually.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their listings.
- **Database Migrations**: Easily manage the database structure using Laravelâ€™s migration system.

## Learning Journey

Throughout this project, I gained significant knowledge and a deeper understanding of the Laravel framework. The hands-on experience allowed me to explore various features of Laravel, such as routing, middleware, Eloquent ORM, and Blade templating. I owe a great deal of my learning to the tutorial by Traversy Media, which served as an excellent starting point for this project.

## Thank you for checking out this project. Happy coding!
